        * mod_ntlm.c and ntlmssp.inc.c:
        Windows 9x now can authenticate against mod_ntlm
        (support for old lm (LanManager)protocol implemented)

2000-10-25  Sverre H. Huseby  <shh(at)thathost.com>

	* Documentation/mod_ntlm.html: Added docs from Markus regarding NT
	groups.

2000-10-18  Sverre H. Huseby  <shh(at)thathost.com>

	* mod_ntlm.c: Included patches from Markus.Rietzler(at)rzf.fin-nrw.de
	to support NT groups.

2000-07-11  Sverre H. Huseby  <shh(at)thathost.com>

	* ntlmssp.inc.c: Disabled two `unsigned char data[0]' in the
	structs, as they failed to compile on HP/UX, and were not used
	anyway.  Thanks to Markus.Rietzler(at)rzf.fin-nrw.de for reporting
	this.  Please note that using structs for passing binary data
	across different platforms is a BAD THING.  Someone should rewrite
	this stuff.

2000-05-27  Sverre H. Huseby  <sverrehu(at)online.no>

	* Documentation/mod_ntlm.html: Added description of the Basic
	authentication settings.

2000-05-23  Sverre H. Huseby  <sverrehu(at)online.no>

	* mod_ntlm.c: Added optional support for using Apache's built in
	ap_base64decode/encode rather than the inline copy used
	previously.  If it works as expected, we may remove the old code
	later.  Look for the USE_APACHE_PROVIDED_UU_FUNCTIONS macro.

	* ntlmssp.inc.c: added different return values to the
	ntlm_msgX_getXXX functions, to be able to spot which one is
	troublesome.

2000-05-16  Sverre H. Huseby  <sverrehu(at)online.no>

	* Restructured everything so that all *.c files (renamed from
	.c to .inc.c) are #include'd rather than linked.  Made every
	function and variable static.  This way we don't pollute the
	name space inside Apache.

	* Encapsulated all .h files in #ifdef's, to be able to include
	several times without redefining anything.

	* Ran GNU indent on all files, to have consistent look.  Did
	some manual cleanup, and expanded all tabs to spaces.

	* Removed lots of unused functions and variables.

	* Removed md4.c, config.h and smblib.h

2000-05-11  Sverre H. Huseby  <sverrehu(at)online.no>

	* mod_ntlm.c: Implemented optional authentication using Basic in
	addition to NTLM, so that other browsers than MSIE will be able to
	connect too.
	
	Fixed a bug causing a failed authentication to succeed if the user
	reloaded the page (!).  To solve this problem, the variable
	auth_ok was added to ntlm_connect_rec.

	* ntlmssp.h: function ntlm_msg3_gethostname failed at my place,
	causing the entire authentication to fail.  As I couldn't see any
	utilisation of the hostname anywhere, I made this function return
	0 even if it fails.  This should probably be looked into, and be
	fixed the "correct" way.
