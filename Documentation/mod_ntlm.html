<p>
NTLM  is an authentication protocol used by
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/iis/">Microsoft Internet Informations
Server(tm)</a>
and
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/">Microsoft Internet Explorer(tm)</a>.
While it is not really secure, it offers background authentication (the
workstation logon credentials of users are passed through to the web
server). This feature is widely used in intranets based on these
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> products.
<p>

<p>
This module is implementing NTLM authentication for Apache on Unix
platforms.  It is available free of charges under the BSD License.
</p>

<h2>Download</h2>
The source code of 
<a href="http://modntlm.sourceforge.net/">mod_ntlm</a> 
is available for download through the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=4906">
Sourceforge project page</a>.

<h2>Install</h2>
<p>
You have to be root to compile and install mod_ntlm.c
successfully. You need a ready-to-run apache distribution
installed. Go to the source distribution directory of
<a href="http://modntlm.sourceforge.net/">mod_ntlm</a> and enter:
</p>
<p><b>
make install && make restart
</b></p>
<p>
The Makefile is using apxs to compile and install mod_ntlm. Certain
versions of apxs are known to fail under certain versions of 
<a href="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE Linux</a>.<BR>
It works fine for me with SuSE Linux 6.3 and Solaris 2.6, no other 
platforms have been tested yet. 
</p>

<h2>Directives in http.conf</h2>
<p>
This directives can be placed into a virtual directory to
configure <a href="http://modntlm.sourceforge.net/">mod_ntlm</a>:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td><b>NTLMAuth</b> <i>on/off</i></td>
<td>enable/disable NTLM authentication</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>AuthNTGroups</b> <i>filename</i></td>
<td>restrict access by looking up users in plain text group files (see
<a href="#NT">below</a>)</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>NTLMAuthoritative</b> <i>on/off</i></td>
<td>allow users who couldn't be authenticated to be handled by other 
authentication modules</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>NTLMDomain</b> <i>domain_name</i></td>
<td>Domain users should be authenticated against</td></tr>
	     
<tr><td><b>NTLMServer</b> <i>server_name or ip_addr</i></td>
<td>Primary SMB server to authenticate users (Windows NT or Samba)</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>NTLMBackup</b> <i>server_name or ip_addr</i></td>
<td>Backup SMB server to authenticate users if primary is down</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>NTLMBasicAuth</b> <i>on/off</i></td>
<td>enable/disable Basic authentication in addition to NTLM
authentication.  Note that setting NTLMAuth to off disables the Basic
authentication of this module too.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>NTLMBasicRealm</b> <i>realm</i></td>
<td>The realm to pass to the client for Basic authentication.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Require valid-user<b></td>
<td>Every user that is accepted by the SMB server can access this
resource</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Require user</b> <i>user_name</i></td>
<td>Only this specific user(s) are allowed. Specify one or multiple users
separated by spaces</td></tr>

</table>

<p>
Example configuration for httpd.conf:

<pre>
     AuthType NTLM
     NTLMAuth on
     NTLMAuthoritative on
     NTLMDomain UWSPDOM
     NTLMServer dc1
     NTLMBackup dc2
     Require user agal
</pre>

<h2>Comments, Limitations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Internet Explorer 3.0 (broken keepalive) is not supported, it's
about time to get a new browsers. Those users should have taken their
computers away for using year old software.</li>

<li>You can produce a problem by pressing <b>reload</b> fast and
often. The connection is forced into reset each time, and sometimes
Internet Explorer is sending a <b>msg3</b> to an apache process that
didn't send the <b>msg1</b> yet.  I'm not sure weather this is an
apache or Linux or IE problem. It could be resolved by caching
credentials, which is unsafe and involves neat things like file
locking and mmap().</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="NT">AuthNTGroups</a></h2>
So far it is not possible to use group authentication with mod_ntlm,
see section <i>Limitations</i> below.  This patched version implements
a first (and very basic) group authentication to use with <tt>require
group</tt> directive.  To achieve this I (Markus Rietzler) have
"borrowed" some code from the original mod_auth.c module, which comes
with apache source (see my comments <tt>/* rit, ... */</tt> in
mod_ntlm.c).<p>

Now you can use the following configuration options:

<pre>
     AuthType NTLM
     AuthNTGroups <i>/usr/local/apache/conf/ntgroup</i>
     NTLMAuth on
     NTLMAuthoritative on
     NTLMDomain UWSPDOM
     NTLMServer dc1
     NTLMBackup dc2
     Require group admi
</pre>

The user-group-definition will be done in
<tt>/usr/local/apache/conf/ntgroup</tt> (at the moment) by hand (!)

<pre>
     admi: joe jane
     office: jim jeff
</pre>

The authentication process will work in two steps:
<ol>
<li>check the user against DC
<li>if user is authenticated via DC, check whether user is member of
group <i>admi</i>
</ol>

After successful authentication via <tt>require group</tt>, there will
be a new environment variable: <tt>REMOTE_NTGROUP</tt>.<p>

At the moment it is necessary to handle the group settings
manually. With the new Samba TNG branch you can use <i>samedit</i> to
receive all the required information (e.g. all nt-groups and all the
users in one group). At the moment we are working on an automatic
export of all of the nt-groups (and users) via some shell or perl
script...<p>

Tested with: apache 2.0.40 (with mod_so, mod_expire, mod_perl) under
hp-ux 11.0.<p>

<h2>Bugs, missing features</h2>
<ul>
<li>not enough tested</li>

<li>autoconf has to be done</li>

<li>test on more platforms</li>

<li>figure out how to fetch user groups from the DC (well, wait untill
SAMBA_TNG is able to do that and then borrow the code)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

Any kind of feedback is appreciated. I'm interessted in bug reports
but also success stories.
